# SRCNN-Keras
Implement SRCNN via Keras with Theano as backend. For a fair comparison with published works, low-resolution images are produced by Matlab imresize function.

# Training
1. generate training patches using matlab 
2. use Keras with Theano as backend
3. convert Keras model to .Mat for testing using Matconvnet

# Dependencies
[Theano](http://github.com/Theano/Theano), [Keras](http://github.com/fchollet/keras), [Matconvnet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/).
